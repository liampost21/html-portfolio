<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Sports fan, designer, pop vinyl enthusiast. 
  That's just some of the things that help summarise me. 
  I graduated Applied Computing from The University of Dundee in 2019. 
  During my final year while working on my honours project, Bon Appetit, 
  I realised I wanted to carve a career in UX/UI Design. I am based in Dundee, Scotland.</p>

<p>To help me gain a career in design I have been working on my portfolio. 
  I have completed projects that are self initiated as well as doing work for non-profit organisations.</p>

<p>Since graduating I have been developing my skills with design software such as Adobe XD, Figma, 
  Webflow and Photoshop as well as project management tool Trello.</p>
