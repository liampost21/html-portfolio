<h1>The Best Movies According to Liam</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time </h2>

<hr />

<h3>Last Night in Soho</h3>
<p>Good soundtrack and 60s vibe. Great acting too from the two female leads. </p>

<h3>Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2</h3>
<p>Great violent action scenes and a great revenge story.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>I love superhero films and this is the best Joker performance (or maybe any performance) that you will ever see.</p>

<h3>Pearl</h3>
<p>Amazing performance from female lead, so many quotes in the film too. Great character in Pearl. I also really like the colours in this film.</p>

<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>Classic Marvel action and has the best superhero war scene ever.</p>
